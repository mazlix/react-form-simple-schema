# React Form Simple Schema Component

This is a *(currently draft)* Form Builder and Validator package for
React
which uses a schema from
Simple Schema
*(for Meteor)*
to build a form *(optionally)*
and validate a form *(optionally)*

You can view the results thanks to
[React Storybook](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook)

- [ ] build complex forms, nested Array
- [ ] build complex forms, nested Object
- [ ] support some of the common options for AutoForm
 - [ ] support `omitFields` && `fields`

#### Consider

- [ ] replicate/use alternate form components: unstyled, custom, material-ui, etc.
